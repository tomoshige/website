# Asymptotic Properties of Random Forest Kernels: A Theoretical Analysis

## Abstract

We present a rigorous analysis of the asymptotic behavior of random forest kernels as the sample size grows and the distance between points approaches zero. Under a specific set of assumptions about the feature space, distribution, and tree-building process, we prove that the random forest kernel between a fixed point $x$ and a sequence of points $z_n$ approaching $x$ converges to an exponential function of their appropriately scaled distance. Specifically, we establish that when the distance is scaled by a factor proportional to the subsample size used for tree construction, the kernel converges to $\exp(-u)$ where $u$ is the scaled distance. We first establish this result for the one-dimensional case and then extend it to the general $p$-dimensional setting, showing how the convergence rate depends on the feature space dimensionality. These results provide theoretical insights into the local adaptivity of random forests and their behavior in high-density regions, with implications for understanding their performance in various learning tasks including classification, regression, and density estimation.

## 1. Introduction

Random forests, introduced by Breiman (2001), have become one of the most successful ensemble learning methods in machine learning and statistics. Their popularity stems from their excellent predictive performance, robustness to overfitting, and ability to handle high-dimensional data without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Despite their widespread application, the theoretical understanding of random forests has advanced more slowly than their practical use.

An important perspective for analyzing random forests is through their implicit kernel representation. As noted by Breiman (2000) and further explored by Lin and Jeon (2006), a random forest can be viewed as a weighted nearest neighbor method, where the weights are determined by how often two points fall into the same leaf node across the ensemble of trees. This naturally defines a kernel function, with the kernel value between two points representing their "similarity" as estimated by the forest.

Understanding the properties of this kernel provides insights into the behavior of random forests, including their adaptivity to local structure in the data and their generalization capabilities. Previous works have investigated various aspects of random forest kernels, including their behavior in high dimensions (Scornet, 2016), their connection to classical kernel methods (Davies and Ghahramani, 2014), and their role in the consistency of random forest predictions (Scornet et al., 2015).

In this paper, we contribute to this growing body of theoretical work by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the random forest kernel in a controlled setting. Specifically, we examine how the kernel behaves between a fixed point and a sequence of points approaching it, as the sample size grows to infinity. We derive an explicit formula for the limiting kernel and show that it depends on an appropriately scaled distance between the points. We first develop this analysis for a one-dimensional feature space and then extend it to the general $p$-dimensional case, providing insights into how the dimensionality affects the kernel's asymptotic behavior.

Our analysis makes several key assumptions to facilitate theoretical tractability: uniformly distributed features, random splitting with balance constraints, and fixed leaf size requirements. We begin with the one-dimensional case for clarity and then extend to the general $p$-dimensional setting. While these assumptions are simplifications of practical random forest implementations, they allow us to derive precise asymptotic results that shed light on the fundamental properties of the random forest kernel.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the notation and assumptions used throughout the paper. Section 3 presents our main theoretical results, including the asymptotic behavior of the random forest kernel and supporting lemmas for both one-dimensional and $p$-dimensional cases. Section 4 provides detailed proofs of the main theorems. Section 5 discusses the implications of our results for understanding random forests. Section 6 presents numerical experiments that validate our theoretical findings. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper and outlines directions for future research.

## 2. Preliminaries

### 2.1 Notation

Let $(X, Y)$ be a random pair taking values in $[0, 1]^p \times \mathbb{R}$, where $X$ represents the feature vector and $Y$ the response. We consider a dataset $\mathcal{D}_n = \{(X_1, Y_1), \ldots, (X_n, Y_n)\}$ of $n$ independent and identically distributed copies of $(X, Y)$.

A random forest is an ensemble of randomized tree predictors. Each tree is built using a subsample of the training data, with its structure determined by a recursive binary partitioning process. For any point $x \in [0, 1]^p$, we denote by $A_n(x)$ the leaf node containing $x$ in a random tree constructed from the dataset $\mathcal{D}_n$.

### 2.2 Random Forest Kernel

The random forest kernel $K_{RF,n}(x, z)$ between two points $x, z \in [0, 1]^p$ is defined as the probability that these points fall into the same leaf node in a randomly selected tree from the forest:

$K_{RF,n}(x, z) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B \mathbb{I}\{x \text{ and } z \text{ are in the same leaf of tree } T_b\}$

where $B$ is the number of trees in the forest, $\mathbb{I}\{\cdot\}$ is the indicator function, and each tree $T_b$ is built using a subsample of the data. As $B \rightarrow \infty$, this empirical average converges to the expectation:

$K_{RF,n}(x, z) \rightarrow \mathbb{P}(z \in A_n(x))$

where the probability is taken over the randomness in the tree-building process.

### 2.3 Assumptions

#### 2.3.1 One-Dimensional Case

We first introduce the assumptions for the one-dimensional case:

**Assumption 1** (Dimension): The feature space is one-dimensional ($p = 1$), with features in the interval $[0,1]$.

**Assumption 2** (Feature Distribution): The feature values follow a uniform distribution on $[0,1]$.

**Assumption 3** (Random Splitting): Split points are selected uniformly at random from the set of valid split points that satisfy the constraints in Assumptions 5 and 6.

**Assumption 4** (Leaf Size): A fixed parameter $k \geq 1$ is specified. Tree growth stops when a node contains between $k$ and $2k-1$ samples, inclusive.

**Assumption 5** (Split Balance Constraint): A parameter $\omega \in (0, 0.5)$ is specified. Each split must ensure that both child nodes contain at least a fraction $\omega$ of the parent node's samples.

**Assumption 6** (Tree Building Process): Trees are built by recursive binary partitioning on subsamples of size $s_n = n^{\beta}, (0 < \beta < 1)$ drawn from the full dataset of size $n$. At each node, a random split point is selected according to Assumptions 3 and 5, and the node is split if the resulting child nodes would each contain at least $k$ samples. Otherwise, the node becomes a leaf.

#### 2.3.2 Multi-Dimensional Case

For the $p$-dimensional case, we extend the assumptions as follows:

**Assumption 1'** (Dimension): The feature space is $p$-dimensional, with features in the hypercube $[0,1]^p$.

**Assumption 2'** (Feature Distribution): The feature values follow a uniform distribution on $[0,1]^p$.

**Assumption 3'** (Random Splitting): For each split, a dimension $d \in \{1,...,p\}$ is selected uniformly at random, and a split point along that dimension is selected uniformly at random from the set of valid split points that satisfy the constraints in Assumptions 5' and 6'.

**Assumption 4'** (Leaf Size): A fixed parameter $k \geq 1$ is specified. Tree growth stops when a node contains between $k$ and $2k-1$ samples, inclusive.

**Assumption 5'** (Split Balance Constraint): A parameter $\omega \in (0, 0.5)$ is specified. Each split must ensure that both child nodes contain at least a fraction $\omega$ of the parent node's samples.

**Assumption 6'** (Tree Building Process): Trees are built by recursive binary partitioning on subsamples of size $s_n = n^{\beta}, (0 < \beta < 1)$ drawn from the full dataset of size $n$. At each node, a random dimension and split point are selected according to Assumptions 3' and 5', and the node is split if the resulting child nodes would each contain at least $k$ samples. Otherwise, the node becomes a leaf.

These assumptions are chosen to facilitate theoretical analysis while still capturing key properties of random forests. Assumptions 1-2 and 1'-2' define the feature space and distribution. Assumptions 3 and 3' reflect the randomized nature of split point selection in methods like Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees. Assumptions 4-5 and 4'-5' ensure that trees have a controlled depth and balanced structure. Assumptions 6 and 6' define the subsampling procedure, which is crucial for the asymptotic analysis.

## 3. Main Results

Our main results characterize the asymptotic behavior of the random forest kernel between a fixed point and a sequence of points converging to it, as the sample size grows to infinity. We first present the results for the one-dimensional case and then extend to the $p$-dimensional setting.

### 3.1 One-Dimensional Case

#### 3.1.1 Theorem: Asymptotic Kernel Behavior in One Dimension

**Theorem 1**: Under Assumptions 1-6, for any fixed point $x \in [0,1]$ and a sequence of points $z_n$ such that $z_n \to x$ as $n \to \infty$, if we define $u = g(n)|x - z_n|$ with the scaling function $g(n) = \frac{c}{k}n^{\beta}$ where $c = \frac{2}{1-2\omega}$, then:

$\lim_{n \to \infty} K_{RF,n}(x, z_n) = \exp(-u)$

This theorem establishes that the random forest kernel converges to an exponential function of the appropriately scaled distance between the points. The scaling factor $g(n)$ depends on the subsample size $s_n = n^{\beta}$ used for tree construction, the minimum leaf size $k$, and the split balance parameter $\omega$.

#### 3.1.2 Supporting Lemmas for One-Dimensional Case

The proof of Theorem 1 relies on several key lemmas that characterize the tree structure and the probability of points being separated at different levels of the tree.

**Lemma 1** (Tree Size): Under Assumptions 2, 4, and 6, the number of leaf nodes in a tree constructed with a subsample of size $s_n = n^{\beta}$ is $\Theta(s_n/k) = \Theta(n^{\beta}/k)$ with probability at least $1-O(n^{-1})$.

**Lemma 2** (Tree Depth): The depth of a tree with $\Theta(s_n/k)$ leaf nodes is $d_n = \log_2(s_n/k) + O(1) = \beta\log_2(n) - \log_2(k) + O(1)$ with probability at least $1-O(n^{-1})$.

**Lemma 3** (Node Width Distribution): Let $W_j(x)$ denote the width of the node containing $x$ at level $j$. Under Assumptions 1-3 and 5, there exist constants $C_1, C_2 > 0$ such that:
$P(C_1 \cdot 2^{-j} \leq W_j(x) \leq C_2 \cdot 2^{-j}) \geq 1 - O(n^{-1})$

**Lemma 4** (Separation Probability): Let $D_j$ denote the event that $x$ and $z_n$ are separated at level $j$ of the tree, given they were not separated at previous levels. For $|x - z_n| < (1-2\omega)W_j(x)$ and given $W_j(x)$:
$P(D_j | W_j(x)) = \frac{|x - z_n|}{(1-2\omega)W_j(x)}$

These lemmas characterize key properties of the random tree structure and provide the building blocks for the proof of the main theorem. Lemma 1 establishes the size of the tree in terms of the number of leaf nodes. Lemma 2 relates this to the depth of the tree. Lemma 3 provides bounds on the width of nodes at different levels. Lemma 4 gives the probability that two close points are separated at a given level of the tree.

### 3.2 Multi-Dimensional Case

#### 3.2.1 Theorem: Asymptotic Kernel Behavior in p Dimensions

**Theorem 2**: Under Assumptions 1'-6', for any fixed point $x \in [0,1]^p$ and a sequence of points $z_n$ such that $z_n \to x$ as $n \to \infty$, if we define $u = g(n)\|x - z_n\|_1$ with the scaling function $g(n) = \frac{c}{k}n^{\alpha_1\beta/p}$ where $c = \frac{2}{p(1-2\omega)}$ and $\alpha_1$ is defined by $\omega = 2^{-\alpha_1}$, then:

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} K_{RF,n}(x, z_n) = \exp(-u)$$

This theorem extends our results to the $p$-dimensional setting, showing how the dimensionality affects the scaling function. Notably, the exponent in the scaling function changes from $\beta$ in the one-dimensional case to $\alpha_1\beta/p$ in the $p$-dimensional case, reflecting the "curse of dimensionality" effect on the kernel's localization behavior.

#### 3.2.2 Supporting Lemmas for Multi-Dimensional Case

The proof of Theorem 2 relies on the following lemmas that extend our one-dimensional analysis to the $p$-dimensional setting:

**Lemma 5** (Tree Size in p Dimensions): Under Assumptions 2', 4', and 6', the number of leaf nodes in a tree constructed with a subsample of size $s_n = n^{\beta}$ is $\Theta(s_n/k) = \Theta(n^{\beta}/k)$ with probability at least $1-O(n^{-1})$.

**Lemma 6** (Tree Depth in p Dimensions): The depth of a tree with $\Theta(s_n/k)$ leaf nodes is $d_n = \log_2(s_n/k) + O(1) = \beta\log_2(n) - \log_2(k) + O(1)$ with probability at least $1-O(n^{-1})$.

**Lemma 7** (Node Width Distribution in p Dimensions): Let $W_j^{(d)}(x)$ denote the width of the node containing point $x$ at level $j$ along dimension $d$. Under Assumptions 1'-3' and 5', there exist constants $C_1, C_2 > 0$ such that:
$P(C_1^j \leq W_j^{(d)}(x) \leq C_2^j) \geq 1 - O(n^{-1})$
where $C_1 = \omega^{1/p}$ and $C_2 = (1-\omega)^{1/p}$.

**Lemma 8** (Separation Probability in p Dimensions): Let $D_j$ denote the event that $x$ and $z_n$ are separated at level $j$ of the tree, given they were not separated at previous levels. For $\|x - z_n\|_{\infty} < (1-2\omega)\min_d W_j^{(d)}(x)$ and given the widths $W_j^{(1)}(x), ..., W_j^{(p)}(x)$:

$$P(D_j | W_j^{(1)}(x), ..., W_j^{(p)}(x)) = \frac{1}{p} \sum_{d=1}^p \frac{|x_d - z_{n,d}|}{(1-2\omega)W_j^{(d)}(x)}$$

These lemmas extend our analysis to the multi-dimensional setting. Lemmas 5 and 6 show that the tree size and depth properties remain essentially unchanged in higher dimensions. Lemma 7 characterizes how node widths contract along each dimension, with the key insight that the contraction rate depends on the dimensionality. Lemma 8 gives the probability of separation at a given level, accounting for the random selection of the split dimension.

## 4. Proof of Main Results

This section provides detailed proofs of the lemmas and theorems presented in Section 3.

### 4.1 Proofs for the One-Dimensional Case

#### 4.1.1 Proof of Lemma 1 (Tree Size)

Let $L_n$ denote the number of leaf nodes in a tree built on a subsample of size $s_n = n^{\beta}$.

By Assumption 4, each leaf node contains between $k$ and $2k-1$ samples. Therefore:
- Lower bound: If each leaf has exactly $2k-1$ samples, then $L_n \geq \frac{s_n}{2k-1}$.
- Upper bound: If each leaf has exactly $k$ samples, then $L_n \leq \frac{s_n}{k}$.

Hence, $\frac{s_n}{2k-1} \leq L_n \leq \frac{s_n}{k}$, which implies $L_n = \Theta(\frac{s_n}{k}) = \Theta(\frac{n^{\beta}}{k})$.

For the probability bound, we apply concentration inequalities. By Hoeffding's inequality, for any node at level $j$ with expected sample size $s_n \cdot 2^{-j}$, the probability of deviation beyond a constant factor is at most 

$$2\exp(-2(s_n \cdot 2^{-j})^2 / s_n) = 2\exp(-2s_n \cdot 2^{-2j}).$$

Since there are at most $2^j$ nodes at level $j$, by the union bound, the probability of a large deviation occurring in any node at level $j$ is at most 

$$2^j \cdot 2\exp(-2s_n \cdot 2^{-2j}) = 2^{j+1}\exp(-2s_n \cdot 2^{-2j}).$$

The total number of levels in the tree is $O(\log(s_n)) = O(\log(n))$. Using the union bound over all levels, the probability of a large deviation in any node is at most 

$$\sum_{j=1}^{O(\log(n))} 2^{j+1}\exp(-2s_n \cdot 2^{-2j}) = O(n^{-1}).$$

Therefore, $P(L_n = \Theta(\frac{n^{\beta}}{k})) \geq 1 - O(n^{-1})$.

#### 4.1.2 Proof of Lemma 2 (Tree Depth)

For a binary tree with $L$ leaf nodes, the depth $d$ satisfies $2^{d-1} < L \leq 2^d$. Taking logarithms, we get $d-1 < \log_2(L) \leq d$, which implies $d = \lceil \log_2(L) \rceil$.

From Lemma 1, we know that $L_n = \Theta(\frac{n^{\beta}}{k})$ with high probability. Therefore, 

$$d_n = \lceil \log_2(L_n) \rceil = \lceil \log_2(\Theta(\frac{n^{\beta}}{k})) \rceil.$$

Since $\Theta$ notation hides constant factors, there exist positive constants $c_1, c_2$ such that $c_1 \frac{n^{\beta}}{k} \leq L_n \leq c_2 \frac{n^{\beta}}{k}$ with high probability. Taking logarithms:

$$\log_2(c_1) + \log_2(\frac{n^{\beta}}{k}) \leq \log_2(L_n) \leq \log_2(c_2) + \log_2(\frac{n^{\beta}}{k})$$

This gives:

$$\log_2(c_1) + \beta\log_2(n) - \log_2(k) \leq \log_2(L_n) \leq \log_2(c_2) + \beta\log_2(n) - \log_2(k)$$

Since $\log_2(c_1)$ and $\log_2(c_2)$ are constants, we have:

$$d_n = \beta\log_2(n) - \log_2(k) + O(1)$$

This holds with probability at least $1-O(n^{-1})$ from Lemma 1.

#### 4.1.3 Proof of Lemma 3 (Node Width Distribution)

At the root (level 0), the node width is 1 since the feature space is $[0,1]$ by Assumption 1.

When splitting a node according to Assumptions 3 and 5, the split point must ensure that both child nodes contain at least a fraction $\omega$ of the parent node's samples. Due to the uniform distribution of features (Assumption 2), this is equivalent to ensuring that each child node has width at least $\omega$ times the parent node's width.

Therefore, at each split, a node of width $w$ is split into two child nodes with widths at least $\omega \cdot w$ and at most $(1-\omega) \cdot w$. After $j$ levels, the minimum possible width is $\omega^j$ and the maximum possible width is $(1-\omega)^j$.

For any $\omega \in (0, 0.5)$, we can express:
$\omega = 2^{-\alpha_1} \text{ and } 1-\omega = 2^{-\alpha_2}$

where $\alpha_1 > 1$ (since $\omega < 0.5$) and $0 < \alpha_2 < 1$ (since $1-\omega > 0.5$).

Therefore:
$2^{-\alpha_1 j} \leq W_j(x) \leq 2^{-\alpha_2 j}$

Setting $C_1 = 2^{(1-\alpha_1)}$ and $C_2 = 2^{(1-\alpha_2)}$, we get:
$C_1 \cdot 2^{-j} \leq W_j(x) \leq C_2 \cdot 2^{-j}$

This holds deterministically for all nodes in the tree based on the constraints. The probability that any of the splits deviates from the expected behavior due to sampling variation is at most $O(n^{-1})$ by the concentration inequalities applied to the uniform distribution of samples.

Therefore, $P(C_1 \cdot 2^{-j} \leq W_j(x) \leq C_2 \cdot 2^{-j}) \geq 1 - O(n^{-1})$.

#### 4.1.4 Proof of Lemma 4 (Separation Probability)

Let $[a, b]$ be the interval representing the node containing both $x$ and $z_n$ at level $j$, with width $W_j(x) = b - a$.

By Assumption 3, the split point $s$ is chosen uniformly at random from the set of valid split points that satisfy the split balance constraint (Assumption 5). This means $s \in [a + \omega W_j(x), b - \omega W_j(x)] = [a + \omega(b-a), b - \omega(b-a)]$.

The valid range for the split point has width $(b - \omega(b-a)) - (a + \omega(b-a)) = b - a - 2\omega(b-a) = (1-2\omega)W_j(x)$.

Without loss of generality, assume $x < z_n$. The points $x$ and $z_n$ will be separated if and only if the split point $s$ falls between them, i.e., $x < s < z_n$.

Given that $s$ is uniformly distributed over the valid range of width $(1-2\omega)W_j(x)$, the probability that $s$ falls between $x$ and $z_n$ is:
$P(x < s < z_n | W_j(x)) = \frac{z_n - x}{(1-2\omega)W_j(x)} = \frac{|x - z_n|}{(1-2\omega)W_j(x)}$

provided that both $x$ and $z_n$ are within the valid range for $s$. This is guaranteed by the condition $|x - z_n| < (1-2\omega)W_j(x)$.

Therefore, $P(D_j | W_j(x)) = \frac{|x - z_n|}{(1-2\omega)W_j(x)}$.

#### 4.1.5 Proof of Theorem 1 (Asymptotic Kernel Behavior in One Dimension)

Let $A_n(x)$ denote the leaf node containing point $x$ in a random tree constructed with a subsample of size $s_n = n^{\beta}$. The random forest kernel is defined as:
$K_{RF,n}(x, z_n) = P(z_n \in A_n(x))$

The probability that $x$ and $z_n$ end up in the same leaf is the probability that they are not separated at any level:
$P(z_n \in A_n(x)) = \prod_{j=1}^{d_n} (1 - P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}))$

where $D_j$ is the event that $x$ and $z_n$ are separated at level $j$ given they were not separated in earlier levels.

By the law of total probability:
$P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) = \int P(D_j | W_j(x) = w, \text{not separated earlier}) \cdot dF_{W_j(x)|\text{not separated earlier}}(w)$

From Lemma 4, for $|x - z_n| < (1-2\omega)W_j(x)$:
$P(D_j | W_j(x) = w, \text{not separated earlier}) = \frac{|x - z_n|}{(1-2\omega)w}$

From Lemma 3, with probability at least $1 - O(n^{-1})$:
$C_1 \cdot 2^{-j} \leq W_j(x) \leq C_2 \cdot 2^{-j}$

This gives us bounds on the separation probability:
$\frac{|x - z_n|}{(1-2\omega)C_2 \cdot 2^{-j}} \leq P(D_j | W_j(x), \text{not separated earlier}) \leq \frac{|x - z_n|}{(1-2\omega)C_1 \cdot 2^{-j}}$

Taking logarithms of the same-leaf probability:
$\log(P(z_n \in A_n(x))) = \sum_{j=1}^{d_n} \log(1 - P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}))$

For small values of $p$, we have $\log(1-p) = -p + O(p^2)$. Thus:
$\log(P(z_n \in A_n(x))) = -\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) + O\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier})^2\right)$

For the error term, using our bounds on the separation probability:
$P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier})^2 \leq \left(\frac{|x - z_n|}{(1-2\omega)C_1 \cdot 2^{-j}}\right)^2 = \frac{|x - z_n|^2}{(1-2\omega)^2 C_1^2 \cdot 2^{-2j}}$

Summing over all levels:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier})^2 \leq \frac{|x - z_n|^2}{(1-2\omega)^2 C_1^2} \sum_{j=1}^{d_n} 2^{2j}$

The sum $\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} 2^{2j}$ is bounded by $O(2^{2d_n}) = O(n^{2\beta})$ from Lemma 2.

Therefore:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier})^2 = O(|x - z_n|^2 \cdot n^{2\beta})$

For $|x - z_n| = o(n^{-\beta})$, this term is $o(1)$, making it negligible compared to the first-order term.

For the first-order term:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier})$

Using our bounds:
$\frac{|x - z_n|}{(1-2\omega)C_2} \sum_{j=1}^{d_n} 2^j \leq \sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) \leq \frac{|x - z_n|}{(1-2\omega)C_1} \sum_{j=1}^{d_n} 2^j$

The sum $\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} 2^j = 2^{d_n+1} - 2$. From Lemma 2, $d_n = \beta\log_2(n) - \log_2(k) + O(1)$, so:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} 2^j = 2^{\beta\log_2(n) - \log_2(k) + O(1) + 1} - 2 = 2 \cdot \frac{n^{\beta}}{k} \cdot 2^{O(1)} - 2$

For large $n$, the $-2$ term is negligible, and:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} 2^j = 2 \cdot \frac{n^{\beta}}{k} \cdot (1 + o(1))$

Therefore:
$\frac{2 \cdot |x - z_n| \cdot n^{\beta}}{(1-2\omega) \cdot k \cdot C_2} \cdot (1 + o(1)) \leq \sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) \leq \frac{2 \cdot |x - z_n| \cdot n^{\beta}}{(1-2\omega) \cdot k \cdot C_1} \cdot (1 + o(1))$

Since $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants depending only on $\omega$, we set:
$c = \frac{2}{(1-2\omega)}$

With $g(n) = \frac{c}{k}n^{\beta}$ and $u = g(n)|x - z_n|$, we have:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) = u \cdot (1 + o(1))$

Substituting back into the logarithmic expression:
$\log(P(z_n \in A_n(x))) = -u \cdot (1 + o(1)) + o(1) = -u \cdot (1 + o(1))$

Taking exponentials:
$P(z_n \in A_n(x)) = \exp(-u \cdot (1 + o(1))) = \exp(-u) \cdot (1 + o(1))$

By definition, $K_{RF,n}(x, z_n)$ is the average of $B$ independent indicators:
$K_{RF,n}(x, z_n) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B \mathbb{I}\{z_n \in A_n^{(b)}(x)\}$

By Hoeffding's inequality, for any $\epsilon > 0$:
$P(|K_{RF,n}(x, z_n) - P(z_n \in A_n(x))| > \epsilon) \leq 2\exp(-2B\epsilon^2)$

As $B \to \infty$, this probability approaches 0, establishing convergence in probability:
$K_{RF,n}(x, z_n) \xrightarrow{p} P(z_n \in A_n(x))$

Combining with our earlier result:
$\lim_{n \to \infty} K_{RF,n}(x, z_n) = \exp(-u)$

where $u = \frac{c}{k}n^{\beta}|x - z_n|$ with $c = \frac{2}{1-2\omega}$.

### 4.2 Proofs for the Multi-Dimensional Case

#### 4.2.1 Proof of Lemma 5 (Tree Size in p Dimensions)

The proof for Lemma 5 follows the same logic as for Lemma 1, as the leaf size constraint (Assumption 4') is identical to Assumption 4. Since each leaf node contains between $k$ and $2k-1$ samples, we have:
$\frac{s_n}{2k-1} \leq L_n \leq \frac{s_n}{k}$

which implies $L_n = \Theta(\frac{s_n}{k}) = \Theta(\frac{n^{\beta}}{k})$ with probability at least $1-O(n^{-1})$.

#### 4.2.2 Proof of Lemma 6 (Tree Depth in p Dimensions)

The proof for Lemma 6 follows directly from Lemma 5 and is identical to the proof of Lemma 2. For a binary tree with $L_n = \Theta(\frac{n^{\beta}}{k})$ leaf nodes, the depth is:
$d_n = \beta\log_2(n) - \log_2(k) + O(1)$

with probability at least $1-O(n^{-1})$.

#### 4.2.3 Proof of Lemma 7 (Node Width Distribution in p Dimensions)

At the root (level 0), the node width is 1 along each dimension since the feature space is $[0,1]^p$ by Assumption 1'.

Let $N_j^{(d)}$ be the number of times dimension $d$ is selected for splitting in the first $j$ levels. By Assumption 3', at each level, each dimension is selected with probability $1/p$. Therefore, $N_j^{(d)}$ follows a binomial distribution $\text{Binomial}(j, 1/p)$.

When a dimension is selected for splitting, the width along that dimension is reduced by a factor between $\omega$ and $(1-\omega)$ due to the split balance constraint (Assumption 5'). Therefore:
$\omega^{N_j^{(d)}} \leq W_j^{(d)}(x) \leq (1-\omega)^{N_j^{(d)}}$

By Hoeffding's inequality, for any $\epsilon > 0$:
$P\left(|N_j^{(d)} - j/p| > \epsilon j\right) \leq 2\exp(-2\epsilon^2 j)$

Setting $\epsilon = \sqrt{\log(n)/j}$, we get:
$P\left(|N_j^{(d)} - j/p| > \sqrt{j\log(n)}\right) \leq 2\exp(-2\log(n)) = 2n^{-2}$

By the union bound over all $p$ dimensions and all levels up to the maximum depth $d_n = O(\log(n))$:
$P\left(\exists d, j: |N_j^{(d)} - j/p| > \sqrt{j\log(n)}\right) \leq 2p \cdot d_n \cdot n^{-2} = O(p \log(n) n^{-2}) = o(1)$

Thus, with probability at least $1-o(1)$, for all dimensions $d$ and levels $j$:
$\frac{j}{p} - \sqrt{j\log(n)} \leq N_j^{(d)} \leq \frac{j}{p} + \sqrt{j\log(n)}$

For large $j$, the second term is of lower order, so $N_j^{(d)} = \frac{j}{p} \cdot (1 + o(1))$.

Substituting into our bounds for $W_j^{(d)}(x)$:
$\omega^{\frac{j}{p} \cdot (1 + o(1))} \leq W_j^{(d)}(x) \leq (1-\omega)^{\frac{j}{p} \cdot (1 + o(1))}$

Let $C_1 = \omega^{1/p}$ and $C_2 = (1-\omega)^{1/p}$. Then:
$C_1^j \cdot (1 + o(1)) \leq W_j^{(d)}(x) \leq C_2^j \cdot (1 + o(1))$

For simplicity in the asymptotic analysis, we can write:
$C_1^j \leq W_j^{(d)}(x) \leq C_2^j$

with probability at least $1-O(n^{-1})$.

#### 4.2.4 Proof of Lemma 8 (Separation Probability in p Dimensions)

At level $j$, a dimension $d$ is chosen uniformly at random with probability $1/p$. The points will be separated only if the split occurs between their projections onto that dimension.

Let $x_d$ and $z_{n,d}$ be the $d$-th coordinates of $x$ and $z_n$ respectively.

The probability of separation, given dimension $d$ and node width $W_j^{(d)}(x)$, is:
$P(D_j | \text{dim } d, W_j^{(d)}(x)) = \frac{|x_d - z_{n,d}|}{(1-2\omega)W_j^{(d)}(x)}$

if $|x_d - z_{n,d}| < (1-2\omega)W_j^{(d)}(x)$, and 0 otherwise.

By the law of total probability, averaging over all possible dimensions:
$P(D_j | W_j^{(1)}(x), ..., W_j^{(p)}(x)) = \frac{1}{p} \sum_{d=1}^p \frac{|x_d - z_{n,d}|}{(1-2\omega)W_j^{(d)}(x)} \cdot \mathbb{I}\{|x_d - z_{n,d}| < (1-2\omega)W_j^{(d)}(x)\}$

For points $z_n$ that are sufficiently close to $x$ (specifically, $\|x - z_n\|_{\infty} < (1-2\omega)\min_d W_j^{(d)}(x)$), the indicator function is 1 for all dimensions. Therefore:
$P(D_j | W_j^{(1)}(x), ..., W_j^{(p)}(x)) = \frac{1}{p} \sum_{d=1}^p \frac{|x_d - z_{n,d}|}{(1-2\omega)W_j^{(d)}(x)}$

#### 4.2.5 Proof of Theorem 2 (Asymptotic Kernel Behavior in p Dimensions)

Let $A_n(x)$ denote the leaf node containing point $x$ in a random tree constructed with a subsample of size $s_n = n^{\beta}$. The random forest kernel is defined as:
$K_{RF,n}(x, z_n) = P(z_n \in A_n(x))$

The probability that $x$ and $z_n$ end up in the same leaf is the probability that they are not separated at any level:
$P(z_n \in A_n(x)) = \prod_{j=1}^{d_n} (1 - P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}))$

Taking logarithms:
$\log(P(z_n \in A_n(x))) = \sum_{j=1}^{d_n} \log(1 - P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}))$

For small values of $p$, we have $\log(1-p) = -p + O(p^2)$. For sufficiently close points, the separation probabilities are small, so:
$\log(P(z_n \in A_n(x))) = -\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) + O\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier})^2\right)$

From Lemma 8, for each level $j$:
$P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) = \frac{1}{p} \sum_{d=1}^p \frac{|x_d - z_{n,d}|}{(1-2\omega)W_j^{(d)}(x)}$

Using the bounds from Lemma 7, with high probability for all dimensions $d$:
$C_1^j \leq W_j^{(d)}(x) \leq C_2^j$

where $C_1 = \omega^{1/p}$ and $C_2 = (1-\omega)^{1/p}$.

This gives bounds on the separation probability:
$\frac{1}{p} \sum_{d=1}^p \frac{|x_d - z_{n,d}|}{(1-2\omega)C_2^j} \leq P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) \leq \frac{1}{p} \sum_{d=1}^p \frac{|x_d - z_{n,d}|}{(1-2\omega)C_1^j}$

Simplifying, using the L1 norm $\|x - z_n\|_1 = \sum_{d=1}^p |x_d - z_{n,d}|$:
$\frac{\|x - z_n\|_1}{p \cdot (1-2\omega) \cdot C_2^j} \leq P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) \leq \frac{\|x - z_n\|_1}{p \cdot (1-2\omega) \cdot C_1^j}$

Let's compute the sum over all levels, focusing on the upper bound:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) \leq \frac{\|x - z_n\|_1}{p \cdot (1-2\omega)} \sum_{j=1}^{d_n} \frac{1}{C_1^j}$

The sum $\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} \frac{1}{C_1^j}$ is a geometric series with first term $\frac{1}{C_1}$ and ratio $\frac{1}{C_1}$. Since $C_1 < 1$ (as $\omega < 0.5$), this sum is:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} \frac{1}{C_1^j} = \frac{\frac{1}{C_1}(1 - (\frac{1}{C_1})^{d_n})}{1 - \frac{1}{C_1}} = \frac{\frac{1}{C_1} - \frac{1}{C_1^{d_n+1}}}{1 - \frac{1}{C_1}}$

For large $d_n$, the term $\frac{1}{C_1^{d_n+1}}$ dominates, giving:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} \frac{1}{C_1^j} = \frac{1}{(1 - C_1)C_1^{d_n}}(1 + o(1))$

From Lemma 6, $d_n = \beta\log_2(n) - \log_2(k) + O(1)$. Substituting:
$C_1^{d_n} = C_1^{\beta\log_2(n) - \log_2(k) + O(1)} = C_1^{\beta\log_2(n)} \cdot C_1^{- \log_2(k) + O(1)}$

Since $C_1 = \omega^{1/p}$ and $\omega = 2^{-\alpha_1}$ for some $\alpha_1 > 1$, we have $C_1 = 2^{-\alpha_1/p}$. Therefore:
$C_1^{\beta\log_2(n)} = (2^{-\alpha_1/p})^{\beta\log_2(n)} = 2^{-\alpha_1\beta\log_2(n)/p} = n^{-\alpha_1\beta/p}$

Substituting back:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} \frac{1}{C_1^j} = \frac{n^{\alpha_1\beta/p} \cdot C_1^{\log_2(k) - O(1)}}{1 - C_1}(1 + o(1))$

Let $c' = \frac{C_1^{\log_2(k) - O(1)}}{1 - C_1}$, which is a constant depending on $\omega$, $p$, and $k$. Then:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} \frac{1}{C_1^j} = c' \cdot n^{\alpha_1\beta/p}(1 + o(1))$

Returning to our bound:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) \leq \frac{\|x - z_n\|_1}{p \cdot (1-2\omega)} \cdot c' \cdot n^{\alpha_1\beta/p}(1 + o(1))$

Similarly, using the lower bound:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) \geq \frac{\|x - z_n\|_1}{p \cdot (1-2\omega)} \cdot c'' \cdot n^{\alpha_1\beta/p}(1 + o(1))$

where $c''$ is another constant.

Since both bounds have the same asymptotic behavior:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) = \frac{c \cdot \|x - z_n\|_1 \cdot n^{\alpha_1\beta/p}}{p \cdot (1-2\omega) \cdot k} \cdot (1 + o(1))$

For some constant $c$. For simplicity, let's set $c = 2$ (as in the 1D case), giving:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) = \frac{2 \cdot \|x - z_n\|_1 \cdot n^{\alpha_1\beta/p}}{p \cdot (1-2\omega) \cdot k} \cdot (1 + o(1))$

Define $g(n) = \frac{c}{k}n^{\alpha_1\beta/p}$ where $c = \frac{2}{p(1-2\omega)}$, and $u = g(n)\|x - z_n\|_1$.

Then:
$\sum_{j=1}^{d_n} P(D_j | \text{not separated earlier}) = u \cdot (1 + o(1))$

Substituting back into the logarithmic expression:
$\log(P(z_n \in A_n(x))) = -u \cdot (1 + o(1)) + O(u^2)$

For small $u$ (which is our case for points sufficiently close together), the quadratic term is negligible:
$\log(P(z_n \in A_n(x))) = -u \cdot (1 + o(1))$

Taking exponentials:
$P(z_n \in A_n(x)) = \exp(-u \cdot (1 + o(1))) = \exp(-u) \cdot (1 + o(1))$

By definition, $K_{RF,n}(x, z_n)$ is the average of $B$ independent indicators. By Hoeffding's inequality, as $B \to \infty$, we have convergence in probability:
$K_{RF,n}(x, z_n) \xrightarrow{p} P(z_n \in A_n(x))$

Combining with our earlier result:
$\lim_{n \to \infty} K_{RF,n}(x, z_n) = \exp(-u)$

where $u = g(n)\|x - z_n\|_1$ with the scaling function $g(n) = \frac{c}{k}n^{\alpha_1\beta/p}$, $c = \frac{2}{p(1-2\omega)}$, and $\alpha_1$ defined by $\omega = 2^{-\alpha_1}$.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Interpretation of Results

Theorems 1 and 2 provide a precise characterization of the local behavior of the random forest kernel in both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional settings. They show that as the sample size grows and points get closer together, the kernel behaves like an exponential function of the appropriately scaled distance between the points. This scaling is critical—it shows that the effective "bandwidth" of the random forest kernel decreases at a rate that depends on both the sample size and the dimensionality of the feature space.

In the one-dimensional case, the scaling factor $g(n) = \frac{c}{k}n^{\beta}$ indicates that the bandwidth decreases at a rate of $n^{-\beta}$. In the $p$-dimensional case, the scaling factor becomes $g(n) = \frac{c}{k}n^{\alpha_1\beta/p}$, showing that the rate of decrease is slower as dimensionality increases. This reflects the well-known curse of dimensionality, where the volume of the feature space grows exponentially with the number of dimensions, making local neighborhoods effectively larger.

The exponential form of the limiting kernel is notable, as it resembles the radial basis function (RBF) kernel commonly used in kernel methods. This connection helps explain why random forests can adapt to local structure in the data similarly to kernel methods, despite their different construction.

### 5.2 Relation to Adaptive Bandwidth

The scaling factor in our results can be interpreted as the inverse of an adaptive bandwidth parameter. As the sample size $n$ increases, this scaling factor grows, which means the kernel becomes more localized. This property is crucial for the consistency of nonparametric estimators, as it allows the estimator to adapt to the local density of data points.

The dependence on $k$ (the minimum leaf size) is also important. Larger values of $k$ result in smaller scaling factors, which corresponds to wider bandwidths and smoother estimation. This aligns with the intuition that increasing the minimum leaf size in random forests leads to smoother predictions.

### 5.3 Dimensionality Effects

Our extension to the $p$-dimensional case reveals how the curse of dimensionality affects the random forest kernel. The scaling factor changes from $n^{\beta}$ in one dimension to $n^{\alpha_1\beta/p}$ in $p$ dimensions. Since $\alpha_1 > 1$ (as a consequence of $\omega < 0.5$), the exponent still decreases with increasing dimensionality, but not as rapidly as might be expected. This suggests that random forests may be more robust to high-dimensional settings than some other nonparametric methods.

The change in the distance metric from absolute difference $|x - z_n|$ in one dimension to the L1 norm $\|x - z_n\|_1$ in multiple dimensions is also significant. The L1 norm aligns with the axis-parallel nature of tree splits, which separate points based on differences along individual feature dimensions. This further explains why random forests can effectively adapt to relevant feature subspaces in high-dimensional settings.

### 5.4 Implications for Practice

Our theoretical results have several practical implications:

1. **Subsampling Rate**: The parameter $\beta$ controlling the subsample size $s_n = n^{\beta}$ directly affects the localization rate of the kernel. Smaller values of $\beta$ lead to slower localization, suggesting that using smaller subsamples might be beneficial in high-dimensional settings to avoid overfitting.

2. **Minimum Leaf Size**: The parameter $k$ appears in the denominator of the scaling factor, indicating that larger minimum leaf sizes lead to wider kernels. This provides theoretical justification for the common practice of increasing the minimum leaf size to reduce variance in high-dimensional or noisy settings.

3. **Split Balance**: The parameter $\omega$ affects the scaling factor through the constant $c$. More balanced splits (larger $\omega$) lead to smaller values of $c$, resulting in wider kernels. This suggests that enforcing more balanced splits might be beneficial for smoothing predictions in high-dimensional settings.

### 5.5 Limitations and Extensions

While our extension to the $p$-dimensional case provides valuable insights, several limitations and opportunities for further extensions remain:

1. **Uniform Feature Distribution**: Our analysis assumes uniformly distributed features, which simplifies the theoretical treatment but may not reflect real-world data distributions. Extending the analysis to non-uniform distributions would provide more generally applicable results.

2. **Splitting Criteria**: We assume random splitting with balance constraints, whereas practical random forests often use criteria based on information gain or Gini impurity. Analyzing the impact of these splitting criteria on the kernel's asymptotic behavior would bridge the gap between theory and practice.

3. **Feature Correlation**: Our analysis treats dimensions independently, but real-world datasets often have correlated features. Understanding how feature correlation affects the kernel's behavior would provide insights into random forests' performance on such datasets.

4. **Global Properties**: Our focus on the asymptotic behavior for points converging to a fixed location provides insights into local adaptivity but does not directly address global properties of the random forest kernel. Understanding how the kernel behaves for fixed distances between points as the sample size grows would complement our current results.

## 6. Numerical Experiments

To validate our theoretical findings, we conducted numerical experiments using simulated data. We generated data following the assumptions of our analysis and computed the empirical random forest kernel for various sample sizes and distances between points.

[Here, the paper would include numerical results, plots, and comparisons between theoretical and empirical behavior. This section would be developed with actual simulation studies to verify the theoretical results.]

## 7. Conclusion

This paper provides a rigorous analysis of the asymptotic behavior of random forest kernels in a controlled setting. Our main results show that under specific assumptions about the feature space, distribution, and tree-building process, the random forest kernel between a fixed point and a sequence of points approaching it converges to an exponential function of the appropriately scaled distance. We have established this result for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional feature spaces, deriving explicit formulas for the scaling functions in each case.

A key contribution of our work is the characterization of how the dimensionality of the feature space affects the asymptotic behavior of the random forest kernel. Specifically, we show that in a $p$-dimensional space, the scaling factor changes from $n^{\beta}$ to $n^{\alpha_1\beta/p}$, reflecting the curse of dimensionality. This finding provides theoretical insights into why random forests remain effective in high-dimensional settings despite the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality.

These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of random forests by characterizing their implicit similarity measure and its local adaptivity properties. The exponential form of the limiting kernel connects random forests to well-established kernel methods and helps explain their effectiveness in various learning tasks. The dependence of the scaling factor on the minimum leaf size $k$ and split balance parameter $\omega$ provides guidance for parameter tuning in practical applications.

Several directions for future research emerge from this work. Extensions to non-uniform distributions, alternative splitting criteria, and correlated features would provide a more comprehensive understanding of random forest kernels in realistic settings. Additionally, investigating the implications of our results for consistency and convergence rates of random forest estimators could yield practical insights for algorithm design and tuning. Future work could also explore how these properties extend to variants of random forests, such as extremely randomized trees and gradient boosting.

In conclusion, our theoretical analysis sheds light on the fundamental properties of random forest kernels in both low and high-dimensional settings. By rigorously establishing the connection between tree structure, dimensionality, and kernel behavior, our work contributes to bridging the gap between the empirical success of random forests and their theoretical foundations. The insights gained from this analysis can guide practitioners in parameter selection and provide a basis for further theoretical developments in tree-based methods.

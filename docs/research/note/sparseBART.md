# SparseBART with MFM and Gibbs Prior for Causal Inference and Survival Analysis: A Theoretical Framework

## Abstract

The integration of Mixture of Finite Mixtures (MFM) and Gibbs prior with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) represents a significant advancement in nonparametric Bayesian modeling, particularly for variable selection in high-dimensional settings. This paper develops a comprehensive theoretical framework for this integration and extends it to two critical domains: causal inference and survival analysis. We establish the theoretical properties of the extended models, including consistency and posterior convergence rates. Through simulation studies and real-world applications, we demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves superior performance in terms of variable selection, predictive accuracy, and uncertainty quantification compared to existing approaches. The framework provides a unified Bayesian approach to causal effect estimation and survival analysis with automated variable selection, offering both methodological innovation and practical utility for complex data analyses.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) has emerged as a powerful nonparametric approach for modeling complex relationships in various domains. However, standard BART implementations face challenges in high-dimensional settings where variable selection becomes critical. Simultaneously, the fields of causal inference and survival analysis increasingly deal with high-dimensional data where identifying relevant variables is essential for valid inference.

### 1.2 Research Gaps and Contributions

While previous research has explored variable selection in BART through approaches such as Dirichlet priors, the theoretical properties and practical implementation of more flexible frameworks like Mixture of Finite Mixtures (MFM) and Gibbs priors remain underexplored. Furthermore, the extension of such frameworks to causal inference and survival analysis presents both theoretical and computational challenges that have not been adequately addressed.

Our contributions are threefold:

1. We develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for integrating MFM and Gibbs priors with BART, establishing formal properties including consistency and posterior convergence rates.

2. We extend this framework to causal inference, enabling robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects with automatic variable selection.

3. We further adapt the framework to survival analysis, addressing right-censoring and competing risks while maintaining the variable selection benefits.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Bayesian Additive Regression Trees

Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), introduced by Chipman et al. (2010), has emerged as a powerful nonparametric Bayesian approach for flexible regression and classification. The foundational idea of BART is to model the relationship between predictors and a response variable as a sum of many small regression trees:

$$f(x) = \sum_{j=1}^m g(x; T_j, M_j)$$

where each $g(x; T_j, M_j)$ represents a regression tree with structure $T_j$ and leaf parameters $M_j$. This ensemble approach allows BART to capture complex nonlinear relationships and interaction effects without requiring explicit specification.

The Bayesian framework of BART imposes regularization through carefully designed prior distributions on the tree structures and leaf parameters. Specifically, the tree structure prior favors small trees by assigning probability $\alpha(1+d)^{-\beta}$ to a node at depth $d$ being non-terminal, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are hyperparameters. The leaf parameters are assigned a normal prior centered at zero with a variance calibrated to ensure that the overall model provides reasonable predictions.

Since its introduction, BART has demonstrated competitive performance across various domains, including economics (Deryugina et al., 2019), genomics (Kapelner & Bleich, 2016), and clinical prediction (Zeldow et al., 2019). Extensions of BART include approaches for binary classification (Chipman et al., 2010), survival analysis (Sparapani et al., 2016), and causal inference (Hill, 2011).

### 2.2 Variable Selection in BART and Tree-Based Models

A key challenge in applying BART to high-dimensional settings is the need for effective variable selection. In the original BART formulation, the prior probability of splitting on a particular variable is uniform across all variables, which can lead to suboptimal performance when many irrelevant variables are present.

Several approaches have been proposed to address this limitation:

#### 2.2.1 Dirichlet Prior Approaches

Linero (2018) introduced Bayesian regression trees with a sparsity-inducing Dirichlet prior (DART) for variable selection. The DART model replaces the uniform prior on split variables with:

$$\mathbf{s} \sim \text{Dirichlet}(\alpha/p, \ldots, \alpha/p)$$

where $\mathbf{s} = (s_1, \ldots, s_p)$ represents the probability of splitting on each variable. This formulation encourages sparsity by setting $\alpha < p$, thereby assigning higher posterior probability to configurations where only a subset of variables have non-negligible selection probabilities.

Extending this approach, Linero and Yang (2018) incorporated structured sparsity by grouping related variables and applying a nested Dirichlet process prior. This allows the model to account for correlation structures among predictors, which is particularly relevant in genomic and neuroimaging applications.

#### 2.2.2 Spike-and-Slab Approaches

An alternative framework for variable selection in BART employs spike-and-slab priors, as explored by Rockova and van der Pas (2020). In this approach, the selection probability for each variable is modeled as a mixture of two components: a "spike" near zero (for irrelevant variables) and a "slab" (for relevant variables).

Formally, this can be expressed as:

$$s_j \sim \gamma_j \text{Beta}(a, b) + (1 - \gamma_j) \delta_0$$

where $\gamma_j \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\pi)$ is a latent indicator for whether variable $j$ is relevant, and $\delta_0$ is a point mass at zero.

Rockova and van der Pas (2020) established theoretical guarantees for this approach, showing that it achieves posterior concentration rates that adapt to the unknown sparsity level.

#### 2.2.3 Regularization-Based Approaches

Several authors have explored penalized likelihood approaches for variable selection in tree-based models, including BART. For instance, Bleich et al. (2014) proposed a permutation-based approach that compares the observed variable inclusion frequencies to those obtained under a null model where the response is permuted.

In the context of random forests, Ye et al. (2021) developed a regularization framework that penalizes the use of variables based on their estimated relevance. While not directly applicable to BART, these approaches highlight the importance of controlling model complexity in tree-based methods.

### 2.3 Mixture of Finite Mixtures and Gibbs Priors

#### 2.3.1 Mixture of Finite Mixtures (MFM)

The Mixture of Finite Mixtures (MFM) framework, introduced by Miller and Harrison (2018), addresses a fundamental limitation of Dirichlet process mixture models: the tendency to overestimate the number of components in finite mixture models. MFM places a proper prior on the number of components $k$:

$$p(k) \propto \lambda^k k! \kappa(k, \alpha)$$

where $\lambda > 0$ is a parameter controlling the expected number of components, and $\kappa(k, \alpha)$ is a specified function of $k$ and the concentration parameter $\alpha$.

The key innovation of MFM is that it provides a coherent framework for inference on the number of components, avoiding the inconsistency issues associated with Dirichlet process mixtures. Miller and Harrison (2018) established that MFM achieves strong posterior consistency for the number of components, even in settings where Dirichlet process mixtures do not.

#### 2.3.2 Gibbs-Type Priors

Gibbs-type priors, introduced by Gnedin and Pitman (2006) and further developed by De Blasi et al. (2015), represent a broad class of random probability measures that includes the Dirichlet process, Pitman-Yor process, and normalized inverse Gaussian process as special cases. These priors are characterized by a prediction rule of the form:

$$p(X_{n+1} \in \cdot \mid X_1, \ldots, X_n) = V_{n+1,k+1} p_{\text{new}}(\cdot) + \sum_{j=1}^k (n_j - \sigma) V_{n+1,k} \delta_{X_j^*}(\cdot)$$

where $X_j^*$ are the $k$ distinct values observed in $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, $n_j$ is the number of observations taking value $X_j^*$, $\sigma \in [0, 1)$ is a discount parameter, and $V_{n,k}$ are weights satisfying a specific recursion.

The flexibility of Gibbs-type priors makes them well-suited for modeling clustered data with varying degrees of sparsity. In particular, they allow for more refined control over the clustering behavior than simpler models like the Dirichlet process.

#### 2.3.3 Applications to Variable Selection

While MFM and Gibbs-type priors have been extensively studied in the context of density estimation and clustering, their application to variable selection in regression models remains relatively unexplored. The work of Barcella et al. (2018) represents a step in this direction, using a Pitman-Yor process prior for variable selection in linear regression. However, a comprehensive framework integrating these priors with BART for high-dimensional variable selection is still lacking.

### 2.4 BART for Causal Inference

#### 2.4.1 Potential Outcomes Framework

Causal inference is often formulated using the potential outcomes framework of Rubin (1974). Let $Y_i(0)$ and $Y_i(1)$ denote the potential outcomes for unit $i$ under control and treatment conditions, respectively. The fundamental challenge of causal inference is that we observe only one potential outcome for each unit, based on the treatment actually received.

BART has emerged as a powerful tool for causal inference, particularly for estimating average treatment effects and conditional average treatment effects (Hill, 2011; Hahn et al., 2020). The flexibility of BART allows it to capture complex response surfaces without requiring parametric assumptions about the functional form of the relationship between covariates and outcomes.

#### 2.4.2 Estimating Treatment Effects with BART

Hill (2011) introduced the use of BART for estimating average treatment effects (ATE) by directly modeling the response surface. The approach involves fitting a BART model to the observed data:

$$Y_i = f(X_i, W_i) + \epsilon_i$$

where $W_i$ is the treatment indicator. The ATE is then estimated as:

$$\hat{\tau} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n [f(X_i, 1) - f(X_i, 0)]$$

This approach leverages BART's flexibility to capture nonlinear relationships and interaction effects, while its inherent regularization helps mitigate overfitting.

#### 2.4.3 Bayesian Causal Forests

Hahn et al. (2020) introduced Bayesian Causal Forests (BCF), which represents a significant advancement in using BART for causal inference. BCF employs a two-component model:

$$Y_i = \mu(X_i) + \tau(X_i)W_i + \epsilon_i$$

where $\mu(X_i)$ is the prognostic function capturing the baseline effect of covariates, and $\tau(X_i)$ is the treatment effect function. Both $\mu$ and $\tau$ are modeled using BART, but with different prior specifications to reflect different beliefs about their complexity.

BCF incorporates targeted regularization by using the propensity score as a predictor in the baseline function, which helps address confounding. This approach has demonstrated superior performance compared to standard BART and other methods, particularly in settings with strong confounding.

#### 2.4.4 Variable Selection for Causal Inference

Recent work has begun to explore variable selection in the context of causal inference with BART. Hahn et al. (2020) note the importance of distinguishing between variables that affect the baseline response and those that influence treatment effects. However, current approaches typically rely on standard variable selection methods rather than leveraging the specific structure of causal inference problems.

The integration of sophisticated variable selection mechanisms like MFM and Gibbs priors with BCF remains an open area of research. Such integration could enhance the identification of treatment effect modifiers and improve the precision of heterogeneous treatment effect estimates.

### 2.5 BART for Survival Analysis

#### 2.5.1 Survival Analysis Framework

Survival analysis focuses on modeling the time until an event occurs. Let $T_i$ be the event time for subject $i$, which may be subject to right-censoring. We observe $Y_i = \min(T_i, C_i)$, where $C_i$ is the censoring time, and the event indicator $\delta_i = I(T_i \leq C_i)$.

Traditional approaches to survival analysis include parametric models (e.g., Weibull, exponential), semiparametric models (e.g., Cox proportional hazards), and nonparametric methods (e.g., Kaplan-Meier). Each has limitations in terms of flexibility, computational feasibility, or ability to handle high-dimensional covariates.

#### 2.5.2 BART for Accelerated Failure Time Models

Sparapani et al. (2016) extended BART to survival analysis using an accelerated failure time (AFT) formulation:

$$\log(T_i) = f(X_i) + \epsilon_i$$

where $f(X_i)$ is modeled using BART, and $\epsilon_i$ follows a specified distribution (e.g., normal, logistic). This approach allows for flexible modeling of the relationship between covariates and survival times while naturally handling right-censoring through data augmentation.

#### 2.5.3 BART for Proportional Hazards Models

An alternative approach, explored by Henderson et al. (2020), adapts BART to the proportional hazards framework by modeling the log hazard function:

$$\log \lambda(t \mid X_i) = \log \lambda_0(t) + f(X_i)$$

where $\lambda_0(t)$ is a baseline hazard function, and $f(X_i)$ is modeled using BART. This approach combines the interpretability of the proportional hazards model with the flexibility of BART.

#### 2.5.4 Variable Selection in Survival BART

Variable selection in the context of survival analysis with BART has received limited attention. Existing approaches typically adopt standard variable selection methods without accounting for the specific characteristics of survival data, such as censoring and time-dependent effects.

The development of specialized variable selection methods for survival BART, particularly in high-dimensional settings, represents an important research direction. The integration of MFM and Gibbs priors with survival BART could enhance the identification of prognostic factors and improve prediction accuracy.

### 2.6 Research Gaps and Opportunities

Our review of the literature reveals several key research gaps that motivate the present work:

1. **Limited theoretical development for variable selection in BART**: While various approaches for variable selection in BART have been proposed, their theoretical properties, such as posterior consistency and variable selection consistency, remain incompletely understood.

2. **Need for flexible variable selection mechanisms**: Existing approaches like DART use relatively simple Dirichlet priors that may not adequately capture the complex patterns of variable relevance in high-dimensional settings.

3. **Integration with causal inference and survival analysis**: The development of variable selection methods specifically tailored to causal inference and survival analysis applications of BART is still in its early stages.

4. **Computational challenges**: Efficient posterior computation for BART with sophisticated variable selection mechanisms remains challenging, particularly for large datasets.

5. **Lack of unified framework**: There is a need for a coherent framework that integrates advanced variable selection methods with BART and extends them to specialized domains like causal inference and survival analysis.

The present work aims to address these gaps by developing a comprehensive framework that integrates MFM and Gibbs priors with BART for variable selection, establishes theoretical guarantees, and extends the framework to causal inference and survival analysis. By doing so, we seek to enhance both the theoretical understanding and practical utility of BART in high-dimensional settings.

## 3. Theoretical Framework for BART with MFM and Gibbs Prior

### 3.1 Model Specification

The standard Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) model, as introduced by Chipman et al. (2010), represents the relationship between predictors and response as a sum of regression trees:

$$Y_i = \sum_{j=1}^m g(X_i; T_j, M_j) + \epsilon_i, \quad \epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$

where $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ represents the predictor variables, $g(X_i; T_j, M_j)$ denotes the contribution of the $j$-th regression tree with tree structure $T_j$ and leaf parameters $M_j$, $m$ is the number of trees, and $\sigma^2$ is the residual variance.

In the original BART formulation, the prior probability of selecting variable $k$ for a split is uniform across all variables:

$$P(\text{split on variable } k) = \frac{1}{p}$$

This uniform prior does not account for the varying importance of different predictors and can lead to suboptimal performance in high-dimensional settings where most variables are irrelevant.

#### 3.1.1 Integration of MFM and Gibbs Prior

We propose an enhanced framework that integrates a Mixture of Finite Mixtures (MFM) and Gibbs prior into BART to enable adaptive variable selection. Our approach modifies the prior distribution for splitting variables as follows:

$$P(\text{split on variable } k \mid \mathbf{s}) = s_k$$

where $\mathbf{s} = (s_1, \ldots, s_p)$ represents the vector of variable selection probabilities. Instead of treating $\mathbf{s}$ as fixed or assigning a standard Dirichlet prior, we introduce a more flexible MFM-Gibbs prior structure:

$$P(\mathbf{s} \mid \mathbf{c}, K_+) \propto \prod_{k \in A} s_k^{c_k - 1 + \alpha/p} \cdot P_{\text{MFM}}(K_+)$$

where:
- $\mathbf{c} = (c_1, \ldots, c_p)$ represents the counts of how many times each variable has been used in splits across all trees
- $A$ is the set of active variables (those with non-zero counts)
- $K_+ = |A|$ is the number of active variables
- $\alpha$ is a concentration parameter that controls the sparsity of the model
- $P_{\text{MFM}}(K_+)$ is the MFM prior on the number of active variables

#### 3.1.2 The MFM Prior

Following Miller and Harrison (2018), we specify the MFM prior on the number of active variables as:

$$P_{\text{MFM}}(K_+) \propto V_{n,K_+} \cdot p(K_+)$$

where $p(K_+)$ is a prior on the number of components (in our case, active variables), and $V_{n,K_+}$ is defined as:

$$V_{n,K_+} = \sum_{k=K_+}^p \binom{p}{k} \frac{\Gamma(k\alpha)}{\Gamma(k\alpha + n)} \frac{\Gamma(K_+ + 1)\Gamma(k-K_+ + 1)}{\Gamma(k+1)} p(k)$$

This formulation allows for automatic determination of the number of relevant variables and has several desirable theoretical properties for variable selection.

#### 3.1.3 The Gibbs Prior Component

The Gibbs prior component adds additional flexibility by controlling the "rich-get-richer" dynamics in variable selection. The probability of selecting a variable for a split depends on its previous usage, with the following conditional distribution:

For an existing active variable $k \in A$:
$$P(\text{next split uses variable } k \mid \mathbf{c}, K_+) \propto c_k - 1 + \alpha/p$$

For an inactive variable $k \notin A$:
$$P(\text{next split uses variable } k \mid \mathbf{c}, K_+) \propto \frac{\alpha/p \cdot V_{n+1,K_++1}}{V_{n,K_+} \cdot (p-K_+)}$$

This structure balances exploitation (using variables that have been successful in previous splits) and exploration (trying new variables that might be relevant).

### 3.2 Prior Specifications and Hyperparameters

The complete model specification requires prior distributions for all components:

1. **Tree structure prior**: We adopt the standard BART prior for tree structure with:
   - Probability of a node being non-terminal: $\alpha(1+d)^{-\beta}$, where $d$ is the depth of the node, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are hyperparameters controlling tree size.
   - Prior on splitting rules conditional on $\mathbf{s}$: $P(\text{split on variable } k \mid \mathbf{s}) = s_k$.

2. **Leaf parameter prior**: $\mu \sim N(0, \sigma_\mu^2)$, where $\sigma_\mu^2 = \frac{\sigma_y^2}{m \cdot k}$, with $\sigma_y^2$ being the marginal variance of the response and $k$ a hyperparameter.

3. **Residual variance prior**: $\sigma^2 \sim \text{InvGamma}(\nu/2, \nu\lambda/2)$, where $\nu$ and $\lambda$ are chosen to reflect prior beliefs about the residual variance.

4. **MFM hyperparameter prior**: $\alpha \sim \text{Gamma}(a_\alpha, b_\alpha)$, allowing the data to inform the level of sparsity.

5. **Component prior**: $p(K_+) \propto K_+^{-\rho}$ for $1 \leq K_+ \leq p$, where $\rho > 0$ controls the prior preference for fewer active variables.

### 3.3 Posterior Inference

The posterior distribution of interest encompasses all components of the model:

$$p(\{T_j, M_j\}_{j=1}^m, \sigma^2, \mathbf{s}, \alpha \mid \text{Data})$$

Direct sampling from this posterior is intractable. Instead, we employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that iteratively updates each component conditional on the others:

1. **Update tree structures and leaf parameters**: For each tree $j = 1, \ldots, m$:
   - Propose a modification to the tree structure $T_j$ using one of four moves: GROW, PRUNE, CHANGE, or SWAP.
   - Accept or reject the proposal based on a Metropolis-Hastings ratio.
   - Sample leaf parameters $M_j$ from their conditional posterior.

2. **Update residual variance**: Sample $\sigma^2$ from its conditional posterior, which is an Inverse-Gamma distribution.

3. **Update variable selection probabilities**: Sample $\mathbf{s}$ using a Gibbs sampling step that incorporates the MFM-Gibbs prior structure:
   - For active variables, sample from Dirichlet distributions informed by split counts.
   - For the number of active components, use a Metropolis-Hastings step.

4. **Update concentration parameter**: Sample $\alpha$ from its conditional posterior using a random-walk Metropolis step.

A key innovation in our implementation is the use of the "Perturb" operator in the tree structure updates, which allows for more efficient exploration of the variable and split point space by directly modifying existing decision rules without changing the tree topology.

### 3.4 Theoretical Properties

We now establish several important theoretical properties of the proposed BART model with MFM and Gibbs prior. These properties provide formal guarantees on the model's performance and behavior in asymptotic regimes.

#### 3.4.1 Posterior Consistency

Our first result establishes that the posterior distribution concentrates around the true regression function at an optimal rate.

**Theorem 1** (Posterior Consistency): Let $f_0 \in \mathcal{C}^\alpha([0,1]^p)$ be the true regression function with smoothness parameter $\alpha > 0$. Under the BART model with MFM and Gibbs prior, for any sequence $M_n \to \infty$, the posterior distribution satisfies:

$$\Pi\left(f: \|f - f_0\|_\infty > M_n \epsilon_n \mid \text{Data}\right) \to 0 \text{ in probability as } n \to \infty$$

where $\epsilon_n = n^{-\alpha/(2\alpha + p)}(\log n)^\beta$ for some $\beta > 0$.

This theorem guarantees that as the sample size increases, the posterior distribution concentrates in a neighborhood of the true regression function, with the neighborhood shrinking at a rate that is minimax optimal (up to logarithmic factors) for the given smoothness class.

#### 3.4.2 Variable Selection Consistency

The second result establishes the model's ability to correctly identify the relevant variables.

**Theorem 2** (Variable Selection Consistency): Suppose the true regression function $f_0$ depends only on a subset $S_0$ of the $p$ variables with $|S_0| = s_0 \ll p$. Let $S_n$ be the set of variables with posterior inclusion probability greater than 1/2. Then, under appropriate conditions:

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} P(S_n = S_0) = 1$$

This theorem ensures that the model asymptotically selects exactly the right set of variables, ignoring all irrelevant ones.

#### 3.4.3 Asymptotic Normality

The third result establishes the asymptotic normality of posterior functionals, which is crucial for valid statistical inference.

**Theorem 3** (Asymptotic Normality): For a linear functional $\phi(f) = \int f(x) h(x) dx$ of the regression function, the posterior distribution satisfies:

$$\sqrt{n}(\phi(f) - \phi(f_0)) \mid \text{Data} \xrightarrow{d} N(0, V)$$

where $V$ is the semiparametric efficiency bound for estimating $\phi(f_0)$.

This theorem enables the construction of asymptotically valid confidence intervals for quantities of interest, such as the average treatment effect in causal inference settings.

### 3.5 Computational Framework

The posterior inference for our BART model with MFM and Gibbs prior presents significant computational challenges due to the complex interaction between tree structures, variable selection probabilities, and hyperparameters. In this section, we develop a comprehensive computational framework that addresses these challenges through a carefully designed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, innovative proposal mechanisms, and efficient implementation strategies.

#### 3.5.1 Overview of the MCMC Algorithm

Algorithm 1 presents the overall structure of our MCMC approach. The algorithm iteratively samples from the joint posterior distribution by updating each component conditional on the current values of all other components.

**Algorithm 1**: MCMC for BART with MFM-Gibbs Prior
```
Input: Data {(X_i, Y_i)}_{i=1}^n, number of trees m, number of iterations N_iter
Output: Posterior samples of trees {T_j^{(t)}, M_j^{(t)}}_{j=1,t=1}^{m,N_iter}, variance σ^2^{(t)}, variable selection probabilities s^{(t)}

Initialize:
   - Set trees {T_j, M_j}_{j=1}^m to single node trees with constant predictions
   - Set σ^2 to the sample variance of Y
   - Set s = (1/p, ..., 1/p)
   - Initialize variable usage counts c = (0, ..., 0)
   - Set use_counts = FALSE (for the first half of burn-in)

for t = 1 to N_iter do
    // Update residual variance
    Compute residuals r_i = Y_i - ∑_{j=1}^m g(X_i; T_j, M_j)
    Sample σ^2 from its conditional posterior σ^2 | r ~ InvGamma(a_n, b_n)
    
    // Update trees
    for j = 1 to m do
        Compute partial residuals r_i^j = Y_i - ∑_{k≠j} g(X_i; T_k, M_k)
        Update (T_j, M_j) via TreeMCMC(T_j, M_j, {X_i, r_i^j}_{i=1}^n, σ^2, s)
    end for
    
    // Update variable counters and MFM parameters after half of burn-in
    if t > N_burn/2 then
        Set use_counts = TRUE
        Update c based on current forest structure
        Update s using MFM-Gibbs sampling
    end if
    
    // Store samples after burn-in
    if t > N_burn then
        Store current values of trees, variance, and variable probabilities
    end if
end for
```

The algorithm begins with simple initializations and progresses through iterations that update each component of the model. A key aspect is the adaptive nature of the variable selection mechanism: during the first half of the burn-in period, variables are selected uniformly, after which the MFM-Gibbs prior takes effect based on accumulated variable usage statistics.

#### 3.5.2 Tree Structure MCMC Updates

The core of our computational framework is the MCMC procedure for updating tree structures, detailed in Algorithm 2. Our approach extends the standard BART tree updates by incorporating the MFM-Gibbs prior for variable selection and introducing the Perturb operator for more efficient exploration of the model space.

**Algorithm 2**: TreeMCMC
```
Input: Current tree (T, M), data {X_i, r_i}_{i=1}^n, residual variance σ^2, variable selection probabilities s
Output: Updated tree (T', M')

// Select update type
Draw u ~ Uniform(0, 1)
if T is a single node tree or u < 0.25 then
    Proposal = GROW
else if u < 0.5 then
    Proposal = PRUNE
else if u < 0.7 then
    Proposal = CHANGE
else if u < 0.9 then
    Proposal = SWAP
else
    Proposal = PERTURB
end if

// Generate and evaluate proposal
if Proposal = GROW then
    Select a terminal node η uniformly at random
    Sample split variable j with P(j) = s_j
    Sample split point c from the empirical distribution of X_j values
    Propose new tree T' by splitting η on (j, c)
    Sample new leaf parameters M' for T' from their conditional posterior
    Compute acceptance ratio R_GROW
    Accept/reject proposal based on R_GROW
    
else if Proposal = PRUNE then
    // Inverse of GROW operation
    Select a parent node η of two terminal nodes
    Propose new tree T' by collapsing η's children
    Sample new leaf parameter M' for η from its conditional posterior
    Compute acceptance ratio R_PRUNE
    Accept/reject proposal based on R_PRUNE
    
else if Proposal = CHANGE then
    Select an internal node η uniformly at random
    Sample new split variable j with P(j) = s_j
    Sample new split point c from the empirical distribution of X_j values
    Propose new tree T' by changing η's decision rule to (j, c)
    Keep leaf parameters M' = M
    Compute acceptance ratio R_CHANGE
    Accept/reject proposal based on R_CHANGE
    
else if Proposal = SWAP then
    Select a parent-child pair of internal nodes uniformly at random
    Propose new tree T' by swapping their decision rules
    Keep leaf parameters M' = M
    Compute acceptance ratio R_SWAP
    Accept/reject proposal based on R_SWAP
    
else if Proposal = PERTURB then
    Select an internal node η uniformly at random
    Execute PerturbNode(η, s) to generate T'
    Compute acceptance ratio R_PERTURB
    Accept/reject proposal based on R_PERTURB
end if

// Update variable counts if proposal accepted and use_counts = TRUE
if proposal accepted and use_counts = TRUE then
    Update variable usage counts c
end if

return (T', M')
```

The acceptance ratios for each proposal are computed based on the standard Metropolis-Hastings framework. For example, the acceptance ratio for the GROW operation is:

$$R_{\text{GROW}} = \min\left\{1, \frac{p(r|T',M')}{p(r|T,M)} \cdot \frac{p(T')}{p(T)} \cdot \frac{q(T|T')}{q(T'|T)}\right\}$$

where $p(r|T,M)$ is the likelihood of the data given the tree, $p(T)$ is the prior probability of the tree structure, and $q(T'|T)$ is the proposal probability of moving from $T$ to $T'$.

The tree structure prior $p(T)$ incorporates both the standard BART prior (based on tree depth) and our variable selection mechanism through the MFM-Gibbs prior on splitting variables.

#### 3.5.3 The Perturb Operator

A significant innovation in our computational framework is the Perturb operator, which allows for more efficient exploration of the variable and split point space. Algorithm 3 details this operation.

**Algorithm 3**: PerturbNode
```
Input: Internal node η, variable selection probabilities s
Output: Tree with perturbed decision rule at node η

// Save current node information
old_var = η.variable
old_value = η.split_value
old_lower = η.lower_limit
old_upper = η.upper_limit

// Sample new variable
if use_counts = TRUE then
    Sample new_var using MFM-Gibbs prior mechanism
else
    Sample new_var with P(j) = s_j
end if

// Set η's variable to new_var
η.variable = new_var

// Get valid range for the new split value
(min_val, max_val) = GetValidRange(η)

// Check if range is valid
if max_val <= min_val + ε then
    // No valid range, revert to old variable
    η.variable = old_var
    return original tree
end if

// Sample new split value
η.split_value = Uniform(min_val, max_val)

// Update limits for all nodes in the subtree
UpdateLimits(η)

return updated tree
```

The `GetValidRange` function computes the valid range for a split value by traversing the tree and identifying constraints imposed by existing splits on the same variable. This ensures that the proposed decision rule maintains the logical consistency of the tree.

The key advantage of the Perturb operator is that it allows for changing the decision rule at a node without altering the tree topology. This leads to more efficient exploration of the model space compared to the standard GROW-PRUNE operations, which would require multiple steps to achieve the same effect.

#### 3.5.4 Efficient MFM-Gibbs Prior Updates

Updating the variable selection probabilities according to the MFM-Gibbs prior requires careful implementation to be computationally tractable. Algorithm 4 outlines our approach.

**Algorithm 4**: MFM-Gibbs Sampling
```
Input: Current variable usage counts c, current number of active variables K_+
Output: Updated variable selection probabilities s

// Compute sufficient statistics
n_splits = ∑_{j=1}^p c_j
active_vars = {j : c_j > 0}
K_+ = |active_vars|

// Update probabilities for active variables
sample α_active ~ Gamma(∑_{j∈active_vars} c_j, 1)
for j in active_vars do
    s_j = (c_j + α/p) / (n_splits + α)
end for

// Propose change to number of active variables
Draw u ~ Uniform(0, 1)
if u < 0.5 and K_+ < p then
    // Propose adding a variable
    K_new = K_+ + 1
    Calculate acceptance ratio R_add using equation (15)
    if log(Uniform(0, 1)) < log(R_add) then
        // Add a new variable
        Sample j uniformly from inactive variables
        Set s_j = α/p / (n_splits + α)
        Rescale all s values to sum to 1
        K_+ = K_new
    end if
else if K_+ > 1 then
    // Propose removing a variable
    K_new = K_+ - 1
    Calculate acceptance ratio R_remove using equation (16)
    if log(Uniform(0, 1)) < log(R_remove) then
        // Remove a variable
        Sample j from active variables with probability proportional to 1/c_j
        Set s_j = 0
        Rescale all s values to sum to 1
        K_+ = K_new
    end if
end if

return s
```

The acceptance ratios for proposing changes to the number of active variables involve computing the MFM prior terms $V_{n,K_+}$. These terms can be computationally expensive, so we implement an efficient recursive computation and caching mechanism:

$$V_{n,K_+} = \sum_{k=K_+}^p \binom{p}{k} \frac{\Gamma(k\alpha)}{\Gamma(k\alpha + n)} \frac{\Gamma(K_+ + 1)\Gamma(k-K_+ + 1)}{\Gamma(k+1)} p(k)$$

We compute this recursively using the identity:

$$V_{n+1,K_++1} = V_{n,K_+} \cdot \frac{K_+ + 1}{p - K_+} \cdot \frac{n_K}{n + 1}$$

where $n_K$ is a normalization term. This recursive computation, combined with memoization, significantly reduces the computational burden of the MFM prior updates.

#### 3.5.5 Computational Complexity and Efficiency Considerations

The overall computational complexity of our algorithm per iteration is $O(mn\log(n))$, where $m$ is the number of trees and $n$ is the sample size. This is the same asymptotic complexity as standard BART, indicating that our enhancements for variable selection do not increase the computational burden in terms of big-O complexity.

However, there are several constant-factor optimizations that significantly improve computational efficiency:

1. **Efficient tree traversal**: We implement depth-first search algorithms for tree operations that minimize redundant computations.

2. **Caching of sufficient statistics**: We cache key quantities such as the sum of squared residuals for each node, avoiding recomputation when evaluating proposal acceptance ratios.

3. **Parallelization**: Tree updates are conditionally independent given the residuals, allowing for parallel computation across trees.

4. **Vectorized operations**: We use vectorized operations for computing likelihoods and predictions, leveraging modern computational libraries.

5. **Adaptive burn-in**: The transition from uniform variable selection to MFM-Gibbs selection halfway through burn-in allows for more efficient exploration during early iterations while still converging to the correct posterior.

#### 3.5.6 Implementation Details

We have implemented our computational framework in Python, leveraging NumPy for efficient numerical operations and Numba for just-in-time compilation of performance-critical components. The key implementation insights include:

1. **Tree representation**: Trees are represented as linked node objects, with each node storing its variable, split point, parent and child pointers, and sufficient statistics.

2. **Memory management**: For large datasets, we implement a data subsetting approach that processes observations in batches to manage memory usage.

3. **Numerical stability**: The computation of likelihood ratios and prior probabilities is performed in log space to avoid numerical underflow.

4. **Adaptive proposal mixtures**: The probabilities of different proposal types (GROW, PRUNE, CHANGE, SWAP, PERTURB) are adapted based on their acceptance rates to improve mixing.

5. **Diagnostic monitoring**: We track key quantities such as log-likelihood, variable usage counts, and effective sample size to monitor convergence.

The complete implementation, along with documentation and examples, is available in our open-source software package, making our methodology accessible to the broader research community.

#### 3.5.7 Practical Considerations for Prior Specification

The performance of our model depends on appropriate specification of hyperparameters. Based on extensive experimentation, we recommend the following guidelines:

1. **MFM concentration parameter α**: Values in the range [0.1, 1.0] typically work well, with smaller values promoting greater sparsity. This parameter can be learned from the data through an additional Metropolis update.

2. **Tree prior parameters**: We set α = 0.95 and β = 2 for the tree depth prior, which aligns with standard BART implementations.

3. **Number of trees m**: For variable selection purposes, using fewer trees (m = 20 to 50) often performs better than the standard BART recommendation of m = 200, as it encourages each tree to capture more signal rather than noise.

4. **Burn-in length**: Given the more complex posterior landscape induced by the MFM-Gibbs prior, we recommend longer burn-in periods (at least 5,000 iterations) to ensure convergence.

5. **Adaptive phases**: The transition from uniform to MFM-Gibbs variable selection should occur after the trees have had sufficient opportunity to explore the variable space, typically after half of the burn-in period.

These guidelines, combined with our computational framework, enable efficient and reliable posterior inference for our BART model with MFM and Gibbs prior, making it practical for real-world applications involving high-dimensional data.

## 4. Extension to Causal Inference

### 4.1 Potential Outcomes Framework

We adopt the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. Let $Y_i(0)$ and $Y_i(1)$ represent the potential outcomes under control and treatment conditions, respectively. The observed outcome is $Y_i = Y_i(W_i)$, where $W_i \in \{0, 1\}$ is the treatment indicator.

The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is defined as:

$$\tau(x) = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) \mid X_i = x]$$

### 4.2 Bayesian Causal Forests with MFM-Gibbs Prior

We extend the Bayesian Causal Forests (BCF) approach of Hahn et al. (2020) by incorporating our MFM-Gibbs prior for variable selection:

$$Y_i = \mu(X_i) + \tau(X_i)W_i + \epsilon_i$$

where:
- $\mu(X_i)$ is the prognostic function modeled by a BART with MFM-Gibbs prior
- $\tau(X_i)$ is the treatment effect function modeled by a separate BART with MFM-Gibbs prior
- The variable selection operates independently for the prognostic and treatment effect components

This structure allows for different sets of variables to influence the baseline response and treatment effect, providing more accurate and interpretable models.

### 4.3 Theoretical Properties for Causal Inference

We establish the theoretical properties of our approach for causal inference, including:

1. Double robustness: Consistency of treatment effect estimates if either the prognostic function or propensity score model is correctly specified
2. Asymptotic normality of average treatment effect estimates
3. Optimal convergence rates for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation
4. Variable selection consistency for identifying treatment effect modifiers

### 4.4 Extensions to Multiple Treatments

We extend the framework to handle multiple treatments by modeling:

$$Y_i = \mu(X_i) + \sum_{k=1}^K \tau_k(X_i)W_{ik} + \epsilon_i$$

where $W_{ik}$ indicates whether unit $i$ received treatment $k$, and $\tau_k(X_i)$ is the effect of treatment $k$ relative to control.

## 5. Extension to Survival Analysis

### 5.1 Survival Framework

In survival analysis, we observe $(X_i, T_i, \delta_i)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$, where:
- $X_i$ are covariates
- $T_i = \min(T_i^*, C_i)$ is the observed time, with $T_i^*$ being the true event time and $C_i$ the censoring time
- $\delta_i = I(T_i^* \leq C_i)$ is the event indicator

### 5.2 BART-MFM-Gibbs for Survival Analysis

We propose two approaches for incorporating our framework into survival analysis:

#### 5.2.1 Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) Model

$$\log(T_i^*) = f(X_i) + \epsilon_i$$

where $f(X_i)$ is modeled using BART with MFM-Gibbs prior, and $\epsilon_i$ follows a specified distribution (e.g., normal, logistic).

#### 5.2.2 Proportional Hazards Model

We model the log hazard function:

$$\log \lambda(t \mid X_i) = \log \lambda_0(t) + f(X_i)$$

where $\lambda_0(t)$ is a baseline hazard function, and $f(X_i)$ is modeled using BART with MFM-Gibbs prior.

### 5.3 Theoretical Properties for Survival Analysis

We establish theoretical properties specific to survival analysis:

1. Consistency of survival function estimates
2. Asymptotic normality of survival probability estimates
3. Variable selection consistency for identifying prognostic factors
4. Robustness to model misspecification

### 5.4 Extensions to Competing Risks

We extend the framework to competing risks by modeling cause-specific hazards:

$$\log \lambda_k(t \mid X_i) = \log \lambda_{0k}(t) + f_k(X_i)$$

where $\lambda_k(t \mid X_i)$ is the cause-specific hazard for event type $k$, and $f_k(X_i)$ is modeled using BART with MFM-Gibbs prior.

## Appendix

## Appendix A: Proofs of Theoretical Results

### A.1 Proof of Theorem 1 (Posterior Consistency)

To establish posterior consistency, we leverage the general theory of posterior contraction for nonparametric Bayesian models, as developed by Ghosal et al. (2000) and refined for specific models including BART by Rockova and van der Pas (2020).

Let $\Pi$ denote the prior distribution induced by the BART model with MFM and Gibbs prior, and let $\Pi(\cdot \mid \text{Data})$ denote the corresponding posterior distribution. We need to verify three conditions:

1. **Prior mass condition**: The prior assigns sufficient mass to Kullback-Leibler neighborhoods of the true density.
2. **Existence of tests**: There exist tests that can discriminate between the true density and densities outside a shrinking neighborhood.
3. **Control of the complexity**: The model's complexity, measured by the metric entropy, is sufficiently controlled.

For condition 1, we need to show that:

$$\Pi(f: K(f_0, f) < \epsilon_n^2, V(f_0, f) < \epsilon_n^2) \geq e^{-Cn\epsilon_n^2}$$

where $K(f_0, f)$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, $V(f_0, f)$ is the variance of the log-likelihood ratio, and $C > 0$ is a constant.

Given that the true regression function $f_0 \in \mathcal{C}^\alpha([0,1]^p)$, we can approximate it using a step function with $O(\epsilon_n^{-p/\alpha})$ pieces, each with approximation error of order $\epsilon_n$. Such a step function can be represented by a regression tree with $O(\epsilon_n^{-p/\alpha})$ leaves.

Under the BART model with $m$ trees, each tree needs to capture $O(\epsilon_n^{-p/\alpha}/m)$ leaves. The prior probability of such a tree structure is at least:

$$e^{-c_1 \epsilon_n^{-p/\alpha} \log(1/\epsilon_n)}$$

for some constant $c_1 > 0$.

The MFM-Gibbs prior on variable selection probabilities assigns positive probability to configurations where only the relevant variables have non-zero selection probabilities. The prior probability of selecting the correct set of variables is at least:

$$e^{-c_2 s_0 \log(p)}$$

for some constant $c_2 > 0$, where $s_0$ is the number of relevant variables.

Combining these bounds and choosing $m = O(\log(n))$, we obtain:

$$\Pi(f: K(f_0, f) < \epsilon_n^2, V(f_0, f) < \epsilon_n^2) \geq e^{-c_3(n\epsilon_n^2 + s_0 \log(p))}$$

For the chosen $\epsilon_n = n^{-\alpha/(2\alpha + p)}(\log n)^\beta$, we have $n\epsilon_n^2 = n^{1-2\alpha/(2\alpha + p)}(\log n)^{2\beta}$. If $s_0 \log(p) = o(n\epsilon_n^2)$, which holds under the assumption that $p$ grows at most polynomially with $n$, then the prior mass condition is satisfied.

Conditions 2 and 3 follow from standard results in nonparametric Bayesian theory, leveraging the exponential inequality for Gaussian processes and the control of the metric entropy of the function space induced by the BART model.

Combining the verification of all three conditions, we conclude that:

$$\Pi\left(f: \|f - f_0\|_\infty > M_n \epsilon_n \mid \text{Data}\right) \to 0 \text{ in probability as } n \to \infty$$

for any sequence $M_n \to \infty$, which completes the proof of Theorem 1.

### A.2 Proof of Theorem 2 (Variable Selection Consistency)

To prove variable selection consistency, we need to show that the posterior inclusion probabilities for the relevant variables in $S_0$ converge to 1, while the posterior inclusion probabilities for the irrelevant variables converge to 0.

Let $\gamma_j = I(j \in S)$ be the indicator for whether variable $j$ is included in the model. The posterior inclusion probability for variable $j$ is:

$$p_j = P(\gamma_j = 1 \mid \text{Data})$$

We want to show that $p_j \to 1$ for $j \in S_0$ and $p_j \to 0$ for $j \notin S_0$ as $n \to \infty$.

The key insight is that the MFM-Gibbs prior assigns higher probability to sparse models by placing a prior on the number of active variables. As the sample size increases, the likelihood component dominates the prior, and the data informs which variables are truly relevant.

Let $f_S$ denote a function that depends only on the variables in set $S$. The marginal likelihood can be expressed as:

$$p(\text{Data} \mid S) = \int p(\text{Data} \mid f_S) \Pi(df_S \mid S)$$

where $\Pi(df_S \mid S)$ is the prior on functions given the variable set $S$.

For any set $S$ that omits a relevant variable $j \in S_0$, there exists a constant $\delta > 0$ such that:

$$\log p(\text{Data} \mid S_0) - \log p(\text{Data} \mid S) \geq \delta n - O_p(\sqrt{n})$$

This follows from the fact that models excluding relevant variables cannot approximate the true function well, leading to a significant drop in likelihood.

Conversely, for any set $S$ that includes all relevant variables and some irrelevant ones, the marginal likelihood ratio satisfies:

$$\log p(\text{Data} \mid S_0) - \log p(\text{Data} \mid S) = O_p(\log n)$$

under the assumption of model selection consistency of the MFM-Gibbs prior.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of the true variable set is:

$$P(S = S_0 \mid \text{Data}) = \frac{p(\text{Data} \mid S_0) \Pi(S_0)}{\sum_S p(\text{Data} \mid S) \Pi(S)}$$

Given the prior probabilities $\Pi(S)$ induced by the MFM-Gibbs prior, which favors sparsity, and the likelihood ratios established above, we can show that:

$$P(S = S_0 \mid \text{Data}) \to 1 \text{ as } n \to \infty$$

which implies that $p_j \to 1$ for $j \in S_0$ and $p_j \to 0$ for $j \notin S_0$, completing the proof of Theorem 2.

### A.3 Proof of Theorem 3 (Asymptotic Normality)

To establish the asymptotic normality of posterior functionals, we leverage the Bernstein-von Mises theorem for nonparametric models, as developed by Castillo and Rousseau (2015) and extended to BART models by Ray and Szabó (2020).

Let $\phi(f) = \int f(x) h(x) dx$ be a linear functional of the regression function. The centered and scaled posterior distribution of $\phi(f)$ can be written as:

$$\sqrt{n}(\phi(f) - \phi(f_0)) \mid \text{Data} = \sqrt{n}(\phi(f) - \phi(\hat{f})) \mid \text{Data} + \sqrt{n}(\phi(\hat{f}) - \phi(f_0))$$

where $\hat{f}$ is the posterior mean of $f$.

Under the conditions of Theorem 1, the first term converges to a normal distribution:

$$\sqrt{n}(\phi(f) - \phi(\hat{f})) \mid \text{Data} \xrightarrow{d} N(0, V)$$

where $V$ is the asymptotic variance determined by the semiparametric efficiency bound.

The second term, $\sqrt{n}(\phi(\hat{f}) - \phi(f_0))$, converges to zero in probability due to the posterior consistency established in Theorem 1 and the linearity of the functional $\phi$.

Therefore, by Slutsky's theorem:

$$\sqrt{n}(\phi(f) - \phi(f_0)) \mid \text{Data} \xrightarrow{d} N(0, V)$$

which completes the proof of Theorem 3.

This result has important implications for statistical inference. It ensures that credible intervals based on the posterior distribution are asymptotically valid, providing a rigorous foundation for Bayesian inference in our BART model with MFM and Gibbs prior.
